I am currently a master’s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). Before that, I obtained my Master Degree from [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/), where I had a wonderful collaboration with [Prof. Dudek](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/p.dudek/pdudek.htm). And I received my Bachelor Degree from [Changchun University of Science & Technology](https://cust.edu.cn/). 

I am proficient in Python and CUDA programming, and I have extensive experience with PyTorch. My previous work has primarily focused on indoor 3D reconstruction. I have developed dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques, implemented SLAM systems based on Gaussian Splatting, and explored feedforward-based SLAM approaches such as [MAST3R](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09756) and [VGGT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11651). In my most recent project, I extended VGGT to outdoor cooperative settings, addressing a V2V SLAM problem. I am highly optimistic about the potential of feedforward 3D models and aspire to extent my research to integrating 3D vision into general-purpose applications, such as VLMs and foundation models.

My research interests lie in 3D Computer Vision and SLAM systems, and I am actively seeking PhD and RA opportunities in the areas of 3D vision, robotics, and vision-language models (VLMs). If you are interested in collaboration in 3D vision or SLAM, please feel free to reach out!
